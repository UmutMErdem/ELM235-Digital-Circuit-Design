# ELM235-Digital-Circuit-Design
These are projects I developed in the digital circuit design lecture.

## Features
- Basic logic circuit design with Boolean algebra
- Glitch creation/removal and BCD Display logic circuit designs
- Design of 2^N x 1 Multiplexers (MUXs) and 2x4, 3x8, 4x16 Decoders and behavioral circuit design
- D-FlipFlop, arithmetic circuits (Half-Adder, Full-Adder, Ripple-Carry Adder) and 32-Bit ALU logic circuit design
- Sequential logic circuit and Finite State Machine (FSM) design
